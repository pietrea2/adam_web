<p>Wow...just look at that...</p><br>


<h1>OpenGL</h1>
<p>This year I discovered the tool OpenGL, and interface with your computer's graphics card that allows for pixel drawing from the use of C/C++ libraries.
These libraries are: glut.h, gl.h, etc. They were easy to download, but challenging to link correctly with my compiler in order to find the glut drawing functions correctly.
Now as the first month of this year unfolds, I am determined to learn how to properly use these GL libraries, as I'm excited to try drawing using C/C++.</p>
<br>
<p>I found a wormhole of examples, projects and OpenGL code online, and it seems like I can create cool projects of my own as well. 
As outdated and primitive these libraries are (first revision from 1994) I enjoy the graphics that I'm able to produce with this; it gives a retro look, simple and chunky colours.
Below are some examples of graphics that I was able to produce for now, I want to try creating grid-like visuals and possibly construct a "Raycast" video game demo, a 3D graphic rendering technique used in games like DOOM.</p>




<h3>First Grid Drawing Demo - Jan 4th 2021</h3>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Next, I downloaded and played with some online OpenGL demos that display the drawing options available. I was drawn to the grid-line rendering of 3D shapes and planes, I like the way lines look here. These images would make fun music album/project covers.</p>

<h3>Final Demos of Week 1</h3>

<br>

<br><br><br>
<p>After compiling more demo files I found online, I decided to go back and start drawing something from scratch. The first image I wanted to create was a 3D infinite grid-world. This turned out to be a very messy looking image, and learned that it doesn't look interesting or recognizable at all. The screen was covered in lines, making it look like a computer program went ballistic. Thus I decided to dial back and properly draw
a simple grid-plane, and I realized that making an interior comprised of grid-walls would look much cleaner and exciting. That will be my goal for the coming weeks. These grid-walls will definetly be used in the "Raycaster" video game demo I will create, which will be inspired by space and nightly adventures.</p>

<h3>Animation Demo 1</h3>
<p>Here we are...making short animations. This is a quick gif generated from the latest update of drawing wired shapes.</p>
<p>The quality is criminal!</p>
